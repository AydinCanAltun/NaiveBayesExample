= Naive Bayes Example
Simple implementation of Naive Bayes on C#.

== Bayes Therom
Bayes Therom is an extension of Conditional Propability. Conditional Propability helps us to determine the propability of A when given B, denoted by P(A|B).

== How This Code Works
In our example, we will determine a bank customer can take loan based on his/her age, income and credit score.

Possible values for age are young, middle age, old.

Possible values for income are low, middle, high.

Possible values for credit score are very risky, medium risk, low risk, good, very good.

Outcome values are Approvable, Not Approved
