= Naive Bayes Example
Simple implementation of Naive Bayes on C#.

== Bayes Therom
Bayes Therom is an extension of Conditional Propability. Conditional Propability helps us to determine the propability of A when given B, denoted by P(A|B).

== How This Code Works
In our example, we will determine a bank customer can take loan based on customer's age, income and credit score.

Possible values for age are *young*, *middle age*, *old*.

Possible values for income are *low*, *middle*, *high*.

Possible values for credit score are *very risky*, *medium risk*, *low risk*, *good*, *very good*.

Outcome values are [green]#*Approvable*#, [red]#*Not Approved*#

=== Training Process
In the training process first we calculate the posibilities of outcomes and then create posibility tables for age, income and credit score.

[colls="1, 1, 1, 1"]

There are 14 different scenario in our dataset so posibilities of outcomes looks like this,

|Not approved
